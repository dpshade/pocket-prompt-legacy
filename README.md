## üöÄ Installation

### From a Release

This is the recommended method for most users.

1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/quamejnr/addae/releases) page.
2.  Download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture (e.g., `addae-linux-amd64`, `addae-darwin-amd64`, `addae-windows-amd64.exe`).
3.  (Optional but recommended) Move the binary to a directory in your system's `PATH` for easy access from anywhere. For example:
    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS
    mv ./addae-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/addae
    
    # Make it executable
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/addae
    ```
4.  Run `addae` from your terminal.

### From Source (for developers)

If you have Go installed, you can build `addae` from the source code.

```bash
go install github.com/quamejnr/addae@latest
```
