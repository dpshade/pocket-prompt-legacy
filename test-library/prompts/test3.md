This is a test prompt with longer content to simulate real-world usage. The async loading should allow the UI to appear immediately while this and other prompts are being loaded in the background.

With the optimizations implemented, users should no longer experience the several-second delay before being able to interact with the application. The UI appears immediately, showing a loading state, and then populates with data as it becomes available.

This improves the user experience significantly by providing immediate feedback and allowing users to start interacting with the interface right away.
